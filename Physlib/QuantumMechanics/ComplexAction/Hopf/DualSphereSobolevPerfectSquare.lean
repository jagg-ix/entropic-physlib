# The Dual-Sphere-Fiber W-functional: the Sobolev `6/5` exponent and perfect-square monotonicity

Ports the genuine, axiom-free **mathematical kernel** of the Navier–Stokes Dual-Sphere-Fiber bridges
(`DualSphereWFunctionalBridge`, `CameronSDGBridge`) into physlib. The source files themselves are *status
records* — `Bool`-valued structures with `:= rfl` theorems reading off which sectors are "controlled" — and
they rest on open conjectures proved by **axioms** (`sdg_implies_cameron_bkm`,
`clms_gives_nonneg_w_ns_integrand`). Neither the vacuous status theorems nor the axioms belong in physlib;
what *is* genuine and portable is the two pieces of real analysis the bridge is *about*:

* the **critical Sobolev exponent** `2n/(n−2)`, which at `n = 3` is `6`, whose Hölder dual is the `6/5` that
  appears intrinsically in the `W_NS` spatial integrand;
* the **perfect-square** structure (the NS analogue of Perelman's monotone entropy / the CLMS chain): a
  functional whose derivative is a perfect square is monotone — the H-theorem / second-law shape, the same
  monotonicity physlib's entropic-time arrow keys on.

* **§A — the 3D Sobolev critical exponent and its `6/5` dual** (`sobolevConjugate`,
  `sobolevConjugate_three`, `sixFifths_holder_dual`, `sixFifths_eq_conjugate`). `2·3/(3−2) = 6`; `6/5` is the
  Hölder conjugate `6/(6−1)` of the 3D Sobolev exponent.
* **§B — perfect square ⟹ monotonicity** (`wFunctional_monotone`). A differentiable functional whose
  derivative is `(g)²` is monotone (`monotone_of_deriv_nonneg` + `sq_nonneg`) — the Perelman/CLMS
  perfect-square ⟹ `W_NS` monotone.
* **§C — the H-theorem / equilibrium reading** (`entropyProduction_nonneg`, `equilibrium_iff_zero_flux`).
  The perfect-square production rate is nonnegative (the second law) and vanishes *iff* its flux does
  (equilibrium / stationarity) — the entropy-monotonicity structure underlying the entropic-time arrow.
