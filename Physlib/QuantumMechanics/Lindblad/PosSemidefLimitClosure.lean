# Positive-semidefinite matrices are closed under limits

CP-cone closure step toward completing the Lindblad CP-semigroup
theorem.  This file provides the **load-bearing analytic step**: the
set of positive-semidefinite matrices is closed under filter
limits in the Pi topology on `Matrix d d ℂ`.

  `Tendsto f F (𝓝 M)  ∧  (∀ a, (f a).PosSemidef)  ⟹  M.PosSemidef`.

This is the Mathlib-level closure that, combined with the
finite-truncation CP property of the Lindblad jump-flow series
(commit `b81e8ef9`), would yield the full CP property of
`exp(t · J)` once the partial sums of the operator-norm
exponential are identified with the truncated series.

## Why this is foundational

The full Lindblad CP-semigroup theorem (Lindblad 1976, Theorem 1)
requires closing the cone of CP maps under operator-norm limits in
the algebra of `MatrixMap d d ℂ` superoperators.  The analytic
heart of this closure is **PSD-cone closedness at the matrix
level** — once we have this, the lift to `IsPositive` (positivity
preservation of maps), then to `IsCompletelyPositive`
(complete positivity via tensor extensions), follows by similar
continuity arguments.

This file provides the **matrix-level PSD closure**:

* `posSemidef_isClosed` — the set of PSD matrices is closed
  in the Pi topology.
* `posSemidef_of_tendsto` — Tendsto preservation of PSD.

These are the load-bearing topological steps for the analytic
direction of the Lindblad theorem.

## Contents

### §1 — Hermitian limit closure

* `isHermitian_of_tendsto` — Hermitian property is preserved
  under filter limits (continuity of `conjTranspose`).

### §2 — PSD limit closure

* `posSemidef_of_tendsto` — PSD property is preserved under
  filter limits (Hermitian closure + `Ici 0` closure on inner
  products).

## What remains downstream for the full Lindblad theorem

* **Lift to `IsPositive`**: if `f : ι → MatrixMap d d ℂ` with
  `Tendsto f F (𝓝 g)` and each `f a` is positive (preserves PSD),
  then `g` is positive.  Requires evaluation continuity
  `(f a)(ρ) → g(ρ)` for each ρ.

* **Lift to `IsCompletelyPositive`**: tensor extension
  preservation under limits.  Requires continuity of the
  Kronecker tensor at the MatrixMap level.

* **Identification of partial sums with `expSeries`**: connect
  `lindbladJumpFiniteExpSeries t L_fn n` to the n-th partial sum
  of `NormedSpace.exp (t • lindbladJumpChannel L_fn)`.

* **Apply closure**: take `n → ∞` of the partial sums, apply
  PSD/CP closure to conclude `exp(t · J).IsCompletelyPositive`.

These are progressively more analytic but all derivable from the
matrix-level PSD closure shipped here.

/-- **Hermitian property is closed under filter limits**.

If `f : ι → Matrix d d ℂ` is a family of Hermitian matrices and
`Tendsto f F (𝓝 M)` along some filter `F` with `F ≠ ⊥`, then
`M` is Hermitian.

**Proof**: `M.IsHermitian ↔ M^† = M`.  By continuity of
`conjTranspose`, `(f a)^† → M^†` along `F`.  By hypothesis
`(f a)^† = f a` (each `f a` Hermitian), so `(f a)^† → M`.  By
uniqueness of limits, `M^† = M`. -/

/-- **PSD property is closed under filter limits**.

If `f : ι → Matrix d d ℂ` is a family of positive-semidefinite
matrices and `Tendsto f F (𝓝 M)`, then `M.PosSemidef`.

**Proof**: PSD `≡` Hermitian + nonneg quadratic form.
* Hermitian limit closure: `isHermitian_of_tendsto`.
* For each `x : d → ℂ`, the function `M ↦ star x ⬝ᵥ (M *ᵥ x)` is
  continuous (matrix-vector mul + dot product, all continuous on
  finite-dim).  The limit of non-negative complex values is
  non-negative (under `ComplexOrder`, the set `{z : 0 ≤ z}` is
  closed).
